<h1> About Us</h1>
<p style="font-size: large;">Just a short time ago, we were fascinated by the idea of predicting malware and malicious URLS. We decided to build a fully 
    functional System that can detect malware and malicious URLS. Our Malware detector uses advanced deep learning algorithms, that can detect whether
    an executable file is a malware or not.<br> And our Malicious URL detector uses advanced Machine Learning algorithms to detect whether the URL entered
    by the user is 
    malicious or not. <br><br>
    Our mission is to help the individuals and companies to get protected from the malicious activities done by cyber criminals and ensure a proper
    cyber security.
