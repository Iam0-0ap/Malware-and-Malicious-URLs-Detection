# Malware-and-Malicious-URLs-Detection
This project is a Machine Learning-based application that detects Malicious URL and Malware using trained models. The model is trained on a large dataset of known malicious URLs and malware samples to learn their characteristics and patterns. When a new URL or executable file is inputted into the application, the model analyzes it and predicts whether it's malicious or not. The application is designed to provide an efficient and effective way to protect against cyber threats and ensure online safety. 

# Note: The trained model for the malicious URL portition could not be uploaded as it's size exceeded the github file upload limit
